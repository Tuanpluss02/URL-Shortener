# URL-Shortener Backend

Welcome to the URL-Shortener Backend repository! This repository serves as the backend component for my URL shortener website, it's available at [URL-Shortener-Launcher](https://github.com/Tuanpluss02/URL-Shortener-Launcher). It provides the necessary functionality to generate shortened URLs and redirect users to their original destinations.

## Features

- URL shortening: The backend allows users to submit long URLs and generates a shorter version.
- Redirection: When a user visits a shortened URL, the backend redirects them to the original destination.
